The Server side of a multi user "Snake" online game.
Server is SnaekServer.py
    Architecture: python 3, with Async IO, aiohttp serving SnakeClient.html, and connect via websockets
    The game_board (a 100 x 100 2d character representation of the playing ground) is kept up to date
    with the values of Snakes and Foods; Therefor you can check for collisions by checking the value of
    the character in the game_board at position (x, y).

Ticks Logic:
    The game is implemented as Ticks (5 per second).
    Tick:
        1. move each snake who's direction is not 'Stop':
            new_head = head of snake + snake direction.

            if new_head x or y are not in bounds: Snake_Dies
            if game_board at new_head is a snake character: Snake_Dies.

            if game_board at new_head is a food:
                - game_board at new_head draw client char
                - push new_head (x, y) onto front of snake
                - remove new_head from foods.
                - find a random (fx, fy) that is Space, add it to foods, and draw food char.
                - add 100 to snake score.

            if game_board at new_head is Space:
                - game_board at new_head draw client char
                - push new_head (x, y) onto front of snake
                - pop last position from snake as tail.
                - game_board at tail draw space
                - add 1 to snake score

        2. Send GameStatus to all connected Clients.

Snake_Dies:
    - Send SnakeDied message to client.
    - erase client snake from the board.
    - Do Reset_A_Client:

Reset_A_Client:
    - new snake head is at random position so new snake is [(x, y), (x, y+1), (x, y+2)]
        where game_board at each [(x, y), (x, y+1), (x, y+2)] == space
            set client snake to new snake
    - draw Client snake on game_board
    - the Client score is set to zero
    - the Client direction is set to "Stop"

When Server receives "Joining":
    - if free_snake_chars is empty then close websocket
    - take a char from free_snake_chars and assign it to the Client as 'char'.
    - the client['username']= username
    - Do Reset_A_Client.

Server When websocket disconnect:
    - return Client char to game_state free_snake_chars.
    - erase client snake from game_board
    - del game_status['clients'][websocket]

Server At Startup:
    - At startup The Server will start a HTTP Server that serves the file SnakeClient.html

implement the client of a multi user "Snake" online game.
The Client part is a single file containing html, css, and javascript called SnakeClient.html

Client Architecture: html, css, javascript, websockets

Display Artifacts:
    GameBoard:
        The GameBoard is a 2d 100 x 100 character array with default character " ".
        The Board needs a frame.
        The Board needs to be resizable, the characters displayed in board need to be resized with board.

    Client List:
        The client list is displayed in a status bar at bottom of window.
        display "{client.char}{client.username}:{client.score} " for each client in game_status.clients
            for example: "🔴Jerry:150  🔵Tom:423"

Client initialization:
    - the Client prompts the user for a username.
    - the Client connects via websocket
    - the Client sends a "Joining" message (which includes the username).

Client detects arrow keys:
    - it sends "DirectionChange" message with 'Up', 'Down', 'Left', or 'Right', which starts the client.

Client receives SnakeDied:
     - client shows pop-up dialog.

Client receives GameStatus:
    - replace GameBoard and Client List with values from message



Read the application description provided.
Rewrite the description into a requirements list.
Give each requirement a unique id.
Group requirements by Server (output filename=Server_Requirements.md) and Client Requirements (output filename=Client_Requirements.md).
.exec
List all messages with thier senders, receivers, a short description, and an example message (output filename=Messages.md).
